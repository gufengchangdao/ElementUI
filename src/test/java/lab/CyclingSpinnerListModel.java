/**
 * This 1.4 example is used by the various SpinnerDemos.
 * It implements a SpinnerListModel that works only with
 * an Object array and that implements cycling (the next
 * value and previous value are never null).  It also
 * lets you optionally associate a spinner model that's
 * linked to this one, so that when a cycle occurs the
 * linked spinner model is updated.
 * <p>
 * The SpinnerDemos use the CyclingSpinnerListModel for
 * a month spinner that (in SpinnerDemo3) is tied to the
 * year spinner, so that -- for example -- when the month
 * changes from December to January, the year increases.
